## Overview

The VirusTotal DXL Python client library provides a high level wrapper for invoking the [VirusTotal API](https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/public-api/)
via the [Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx) (DXL) fabric.

This client requires the [VirusTotal API DXL Service](https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-virustotal-service-python)
to be running and available on the DXL fabric.
